            <h2>Who We Are</h2>
            <p>Take it to the Streets is a non-profit dedicated to helping black motorists fight for their rights as citizens of Chicago. Black motorists are disproportionately targeted by the city's parking fines and tickets. The punishments for not paying debts are not only steeper fines but may even lead to the suspension of a motorist's driver's license.</p>
            <p>The city has taken measures to help combat this epidemic but there is still a large amount of work to be done.</p>

            <h2>Our Purpose</h2>
            <p>To inform Chicago motorists of their rights, provide a list of disputing options, and empower motorists to fight against predatory policing practices. We understand that the city unjustly writes parking tickets and know that the process can be intimidating at first. We want to solve this by educating and providing the necessary resources to appeal your tickets.</p>

        <section id="odds">
            <h2>The Odds are in Your Favor!</h2>
            <p>Unlike popular belief motorists have a strong chance of winning ticket disputes. In fact 60% of all challenged tickets end up with the motorist winning. Even though only 10% of motorists dispute tickets. The odds are in your favor. Do an appeal today!</p>
